/*
 we need to call the function to print binary.
 so we determine the number, but now its a program we dont know
 ok, using that analogy we are given a number
 let's say 2 and we have to convert it to
 its binary representation, so to convert to binary from base 10 (decimal) we usually
 divide by 2 until the remainder is 0
 after that we take the remainder and that is our answer
